## Why the world need Staked Attendace Contract?
People are social animals and when coordinated well can achieve tremendous things. We rely on the nation states or corporations to coordinate individuals. Depending on where you live and work and what is your issue, this works well. In the end we still get electricity for our kettles and education for our children at least in some parts of the world. However, there are still areas of live, where we need decentralized coordination to motivate people to get up and do things!
Everyone who tried assemble people to clean up common (společný) courtyard, upgrade kindergarten garden or organize a skiing trip for friends know this. Everybody wants it, some are willing to help, but only few only show up. There is always something better to do, something of higher priority that restricts us to actually go up do things, there is risk that I will be alone. For project to succed there needs to be 
- assurance of critical mass
- motivation to show up
This is were Staked Attendance Contracts come in play
